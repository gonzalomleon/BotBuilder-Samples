This sample shows how to create a bot that uses Language Understanding (LUIS) with Application Insights to get telemetry around bot and your LUIS application's performance.

# Concepts introduced in this sample
## LUIS with Application Insights
[LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) enables you to build, train and publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured documents or editorial content in minutes.

The [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/) enables you to discover actionable insights through application performance management and instant analytics.

In this sample, we demonstrate how to call LUIS to extract the intents from a user's message and use Application Insights to gather user-bot interaction telemetry.
- Services used in this sample
  -  [`applicationinsights`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/applicationinsights)
  - [`restify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify)
  - [`dotenv`](https://npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

# To try this sample
## Prerequisites
### Clone the repo
To clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
```

## Run the Sample
### Visual Studio Code
- In a terminal, navigate to the following directory:
  ```bash
  cd samples\javascript_nodejs\21.luis-with-appinsights
  ```

  **Optional:** Update the `.env` file under `samples\javascript_nodejs\21.luis-with-appinsights` with your **botFileSecret**.
  For Azure Bot Service bots, you can find the botFileSecret under application settings.

- Install modules and start the bot:
    ```bash
    npm i && npm start
    ```
    Alternatively you can also use nodemon via:
    ```bash
    npm i && npm run watch
    ```

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

Install the Bot Framework emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases).

### Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator **V4**
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- From the *File* menu select *Open Bot Configuration*
- Navigate to your `.bot` file

## Deploy to Azure
### Using CLI Tools
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. In order to install this and other tools, you can read [Installing CLI Tools](../../../Installing_CLI_tools.md).

To clone this bot, run:

```bash
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id>
```
- Write down the secret generated by `MSBot`. 
- The secret key is used later for the emulator and configuration:
  ```bash
  The secret used to decrypt <NAME>.bot is:
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=
    NOTE: This secret is not recoverable and you should store this secret in a secure place according to best security practices.
    Your project may be configured to rely on this secret and you should update it as appropriate.
  ```
- Inspect Bot configuration file.
- The `msbot clone` command above generates a bot configuration file.
- The name of the bot configuration file is `<NAME>.bot`, where `<NAME>` is the name of your bot used in the `msbot clone` step.
- The configuration file can be loaded by the [Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).
