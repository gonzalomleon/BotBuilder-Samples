This sample shows how to create a bot that uses Language Understanding (LUIS). 

# Concepts introduced in this sample
## Language Understanding

[Language Understanding (LUIS)](https://www.luis.ai) is a cloud-based API service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information.

In this sample, we demonstrate how to call LUIS to extract the intents from a user's message.
# To try this sample
## Prerequisites
###	Required Tools
#### Set up LUIS
- Navigate to [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).

- Click the `Sign in` button.

- Click on `My Apps`.

- Click on the `Import new app` button.

- Click on the `Choose File` and select [reminders.json](cognitiveModels/reminders.json) from the `BotBuilder-Samples/javascript_nodejs/12.nlp-with-luis/cognitiveModels` folder.

- Update [nlp-with-luis.bot](nlp-with-luis.bot) file with your AppId, SubscriptionKey, Region and Version. You can find this information under "Manage" tab for your LUIS application at [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).

    - The `AppID` can be found in "Application Information"
    - The `AuthoringKey` can be found in "Keys and Endpoints"
    - The `SubscriptionKey` can be found in "Keys and Endpoints", under the `Key 1` column
    - The `region` can be found in "Keys and Endpoints", under the `Region` column

    The Version is listed on the page.
    Note: Enter the either "authoringKey" OR "subscriptionKey", not both.
    [See an example .bot service configuration for using LUIS here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-luis?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=js#configure-your-bot-to-use-your-luis-app).    

- Update [index.js](index.js) and set the `LUIS_CONFIGURATION` value to match the `name` field in your service declaration.

- Update [nlp-with-luis.bot](nlp-with-luis.bot) file with your Authoring Key.  
    You can find this under your user settings at [luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai).  Click on your name in the upper right hand corner of the portal, and click on the "Settings" menu option.

    NOTE: Once you publish your app on LUIS portal for the first time, it may take some time to go live.

- Your .bot file should now include an item in the services array that looks like this:

    ```javascript
    {
        "type":"luis",
        "name":"<some name>",
        "appId":"<an app id>",
        "version":"<a version number>",
        "authoringKey":"<your authoring key>",
        "subscriptionKey":"<your subscription key>",
        "region":"<region>",
        "id":"<some number>"
    }
    ```
#### (Optional) Install ludown and luis
- Install the `ludown` CLI tool [here](https://aka.ms/using-ludown) to help describe language understanding components for your bot.
- Install the `luis` CLI tool [here](https://aka.ms/using-luis-cli) to create and manage your LUIS applications.
### Clone the repo
To clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
```
## Run the Sample
### Visual Studio Code
- In a terminal, navigate to the following directory:
  ```bash
  cd samples\javascript_nodejs\12.nlp-with-luis
  ```

  **Optional:** Update the `.env` file under `samples\javascript_nodejs\12.nlp-with-luis` with your **botFileSecret**.
  For Azure Bot Service bots, you can find the botFileSecret under application settings.

- Install modules and start the bot:
    ```bash
    npm i && npm start
    ```
    Alternatively you can also use nodemon via:
    ```bash
    npm i && npm run watch
    ```

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

Install the Bot Framework emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases).

### Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator **V4**
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- From the *File* menu select *Open Bot Configuration*
- Navigate to your `.bot` file

## Deploy to Azure
### Using CLI Tools
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. In order to install this and other tools, you can read [Installing CLI Tools](../../../Installing_CLI_tools.md).

To clone this bot, run:

```bash
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id>
```
- Write down the secret generated by `MSBot`. 
- The secret key is used later for the emulator and configuration:
  ```bash
  The secret used to decrypt <NAME>.bot is:
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=
    NOTE: This secret is not recoverable and you should store this secret in a secure place according to best security practices.
    Your project may be configured to rely on this secret and you should update it as appropriate.
  ```
- Inspect Bot configuration file.
- The `msbot clone` command above generates a bot configuration file.
- The name of the bot configuration file is `<NAME>.bot`, where `<NAME>` is the name of your bot used in the `msbot clone` step.
- The configuration file can be loaded by the [Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).
### Deploy from Visual Studio
### Deprovision your bot
